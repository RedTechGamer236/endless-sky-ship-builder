The designers of ALR Manufacturing had great plans to show who the Cleaver belonged to, but the builders ended up deciding to use parts from the original Sunder, and the ship did not look nearly as colorful as the original concept dictated. As the shipyards use imported products such as the Tractor Beam, the Cleaver has a rather high price tag. \tFollowing the tradition, the Cleaver has a roomy cargo bay; enough to make anyone flying it rich. \tAccording to some, it also carries special tools that allow it to harvest resources from the surface of mineral-rich planets or moons."

Enter the \"F6-C: Boxwing,\" the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it \"Flying Coffin\" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot \"seat\" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem. \tWell, the Boxwing wasn't supposed to fight. This maraudified version has a single gun port, equipped with a deadly weapon - the Quad Beam Laser. \tFighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

      "description": "Combat drones are pilotless attack ships used primarily by the Republic Navy. Although very weak and easy to destroy, they can be very effective in large numbers. Because drones do not need a cockpit, they can be filled entirely with equipment and solid metal, which makes their hulls stronger than other small ships. \tThis Combat Drone has been captured from the Navy and Maraudified. It now has space for a Heavy Laser and has a thicker hull - though this comes at the cost of almost doubled mass and a slightly lower top speed. \tDrones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."

It had, however, been anticipated as a part of their contingency plans to support large scale evacuations. The first Remnant survived by running, modern Remnant prosper through mobility, and it is expected that the Remnant of the future shall thrive by those same means. \tThe Swan, thus, was designed first and foremost to be a refueler. Not only carrying a prodigous amount of fuel as well as massive arrays to collect more, but also ferrying a number of fighters and drones that can be used to deliver fuel to other ships in the fleet. It can also carry a significant amount of cargo. \tThe cloaking technology is built into the Swan's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship. The Remnant engineers note that, due to its size, the Swan's cloak is both slower and consumes significantly more energy and fuel than other present-day designs."
